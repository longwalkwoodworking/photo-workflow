# Several points:
# 1) This is clearly a hot mess.
# 2) This batches everything together and runs the conversion in one gimp
# process. gimp -i -b "(gimp-quit TRUE)" takes 2.5 seconds on my (old) machine.
# I can't throw enough cores at the conversions to break even on the repeated
# startup time, so I'm batching them. Users with many cores and much RAM will
# likely dislike this solution. 
# 3) Obviously a pattern rule would be vastly cleaner and as an added bonus
# allow for parallel processing.
